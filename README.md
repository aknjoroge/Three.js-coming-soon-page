<h2 id="description">Description</h2>

The project has two html files : <br/>

1. `index.html` <br/>
2. `developmentMarkUp.html`<br/>

developmentMarkUp.html does Not contain the three.js library and uses the bootstrap.css for its styling. This means that it has unused CSS. The unused can be seen through the developer tools under the coverage analysis tab.

index.html uses the three.js library and has already Purged CSS. This means most of the unused css code has been removed using `purgecss` a package from `npm`

The purgedcss is reformatted to scss and compiled using `node-sass`, more description can be found later.

Both html documents contain a form that uses a php document for mailing.

The file structure is explained [here](#files)

        function (gltf) {
          this.globalHelper.push(gltf.scene);
        }.bind(this),

## Issues

- sometimes when the project loads, the three.js renderer may make the 3D laptop model be downloaded instead of rendering it to the scene
